# Project 4:  Brevet time calculator with Ajax

## Author: Taylor Scott

This program is a brevet time calculator that follows the rules and regulations
set out by RUSA. It starts up a server that a client can access and enter in
brevet start date/times, the length of the brevet, and the distance. The
page will automatically return to the client the open and close times of that
segment. 

Note: Nosetests only work if you type 'nosetests test_acp_times'.
